# how_open_are_conferences
This is a project that I have made that analisys how many people from the program committee of some conferences also have accepted papers in the same conference.

I have done analysed the conferences Infocom, Middleware and NSDI. There may be some years absent in the analysed interval due to lack of time or of encountered resources. 
After writing the NSDI code, I noticed that all the calculations always give a 0% as a result (meaning 0% overlap between the people in the program committee and the authors of the papers) which does not seem right, even though I have reviewed the code multiple times.
Because of having no time left to work on the project, I have decided to leave the NSDI code here, since by all accounts the database is well-made, even if the results are a bit weird.
The rest work exactly as intended.
